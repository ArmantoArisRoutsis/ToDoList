## About
###### This is my Version of the classic To-Do-List. I made this web application using Node.js & Express.js for the backend. For the database I used MongoDB. As for the front end just basic HTML5 & CSS3 was used along with EJS templating. The application gives you the option to add and remove items from a default-list. Aside from that the user is also given the ability to create multiple other lists.
